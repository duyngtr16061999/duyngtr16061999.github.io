I am a PhD student advised by Professor <a href="https://tuanluu.github.io/">Anh-Tuan Luu</a> at Nanyang Technological University. Before that, I was an AI Research Resident at VinAI Research from 2020 to 2022. I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), Vietnam, in 2021.
